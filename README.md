**Code challenge:** Angular.js mobile/web app to graphically display recent earthquake occurrences
and information on a map using data provided by [Seismi's REST API](http://www.seismi.org/api/).

**Solution rationale:** I'm a front-end web developer at heart, so naturally I'm drawn to a solution
in that environment. Beyond personal preference, I believe this is also the most flexible option.
Native implementations excel in providing ease of access to specific device API's (camera, location
services, accelerometer, etc) and in maximising performance. Neither of these concerns are critical
in this simple application (at least initially), so the web app is clearly the most universal
solution in this case.
